  Abilities represent your character's innate capacity for physical, mental and emotional feats.
  Choose your starting scores here. Scores range from -2 (terrible) to 4 (exceptional).
  These scores represent the abilities of normal people like you and me; Albert Einstein would probably

  a score of 4 means that you don't know anyone stronger in that ability than you.
