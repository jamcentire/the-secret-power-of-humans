Abilities represent your character's innate capacity for physical, mental and emotional feats. Choose your starting scores here. Scores range from -2 (terrible) to 4 (exceptional).

These scores represent the abilities of normal people, which you will be playing! Albert Einstein would probably have an Intelligence of 6, and Hafthor Bjornson
would have a strength of 6. For your case, the max score of 4 represents a strong enough ability that you don't know anybody who's better than you at this.
